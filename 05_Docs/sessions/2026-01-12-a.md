### Discovered
- App is notarized but not sandboxed
- Primary use case: batch cropping iOS screenshots for pdf2calendar.eu docs
- "Works for me" polish level — personal tool shared publicly
- 61 downloads on GitHub releases

### Decisions Made
- Project structure: numbered folders (01-05)
- Directions location: `05_Docs/` to match scheme

## Next Session
- Create GitHub release for v1.2
- Build and notarize DMG
- Test corner radius and blur features in production build

## Notes
- Folder watching is on hold
- MAS distribution is a "someday" goal
- v1.2 includes: corner radius, blur intensity fix, folder reorg
