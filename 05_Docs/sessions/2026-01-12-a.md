# Session: 2026-01-12-a

## Goal
Project reorganization and Directions setup

## Context
- Previous session: Various feature work (corner-radius, blur)
- Current phase: implementation

## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Reorganized project to numbered folder structure
  - `01_Project/` — Xcode project and source
  - `02_Design/` — Design assets (empty)
  - `03_Screenshots/` — App screenshots
  - `04_Exports/` — Built app and DMG
  - `05_Docs/` — Directions documentation
- [x] Set up Directions documentation system
- [x] Archived existing docs to `05_Docs/_archive/`
- [x] Populated PROJECT_STATE.md with project info
- [x] Populated decisions.md with 4 key decisions
- [x] Created project CLAUDE.md
- [x] Updated README.md with new paths
- [x] Ran discovery interview

### Discovered
- Two feature branches ready to merge: `corner-radius` and `blur-again`
- App is notarized but not sandboxed
- Primary use case: batch cropping iOS screenshots for pdf2calendar.eu docs
- "Works for me" polish level — personal tool shared publicly

### Decisions Made
- Project structure: numbered folders (01-05)
- Directions location: `05_Docs/` to match scheme

## Next Session
- Merge `corner-radius` to main
- Merge `blur-again` to main
- Verify both features work together
- Test build

## Notes
- 61 downloads on GitHub releases
- Folder watching is on hold
- MAS distribution is a "someday" goal
